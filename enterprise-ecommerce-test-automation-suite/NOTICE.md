# Notice / Attribution

This repository contains an automation framework implementation created and maintained by Jahnavi Redrouthu.

It was bootstrapped from a public template repository (original project credited in Git history / repository metadata).
Subsequent work includes substantial additions such as:
- Playwright + Cucumber TypeScript setup
- BDD feature suites for UI and API smoke testing
- Page Objects, step definitions, and hooks
- CI pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Docker-based execution for consistent environments
